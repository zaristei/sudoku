# sudoku
Me experimenting with making a sudoku solver to see if it makes me a better player

## How to use:
1. Clone repository: `git clone git@github.com:zaristei/sudoku.git`
2. Update Submodules: `git submodule update --init`
3. Go into solver and choose a puzzle difficulty, number of puzzles, and a set of strategies
4. `python solver.py`
5. Have fun!
